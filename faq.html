                    <p>The Steam Curator (tSC) is a curated game store. This means that all games present on the store have undergone a review process. The mission for tSC is to improve visibility for steam games that don't reach the audience they deserve.</p>

                <div class='a-block'>
                    <p>The Steam Curator does not provide regional pricing for games and currently, only support USD($). This is due to hardware/cost limitations, but we would love to implement regional pricing in the future.</p>

                    <p>If you're an enthusiastic fan and think a game deserves to be on this platform you can enter an application over on our discord server. If you are a developer you can also use our discord but use the developer application instead.

                    <p>Games are reviewed individually and have to pass a series of tests to make it onto the storefront. The point of the review system is to avoid asset-flip and low effort games that have increased in numbers on the steam store. This will hopefully increase visibility for talented indie developers. 
                    <br></br>The review process will be based on several factors including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Steam reviews:</span></br>
                            A game will require to have at least or greater than 40% average review rating on steam. Review bombing will be taken into account in the context of the situation. Games which have a less than 40% average steam rating will need to provide reasoning as to why their rating is at that level.</li>
                        <li><span>Reproducibility:</span></br> 
                            Reproducibility determines how much effort was put into a game. A high reproducibility could me two things. The game uses stolen or existing assets or the game is small in scale. Game which are small in scale will not be affected by this metric.</li>
                        <li><span>Uniqueness:</span></br> 
                            This metric will be used in conjunction with the reproducibility metric. It determines how unique the game is. If the game is easily repoducible and is not unique than it is most likely an asset flip type game which are unlikely to appear on this store front.</li>
                        <li><span>Popularity:</span></br> 
                            If the game is popular it will have a higher chance of passing the review process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    Games do not need to fullfill all the requirements but have a higher chance if they do</p>

                <div class='a-block'>
                    <p>The Steam Curator requires donations for server costs. If donations are not able to cover server costs than an alternative monitisation system will have to be implemented (i.e Ads).
